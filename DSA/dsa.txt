#Data Structure and Algorithms in Python
What is Data Structure?
=> DS are differnt way of organizing data on your computer,that can be used effectively

Algorithm: Step by Step Instructions to solve the problem

1) Correctness and Efficiency

Input ==> Processing ==>Output

Linear and Nonlinear DS
